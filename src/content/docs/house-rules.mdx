# Household Rules

To ensure a pleasant stay for all guests, we kindly ask that you follow these basic rules:

- Casa Patron is located in a residential neighborhood and we respect our neighbors' right to peace and quiet.
- No smoking allowed inside the house. Smoking is only allowed outside in designated areas and we kindly ask that you properly dispose of cigarette butts.
- Please do not move furniture around.
- Please turn off all lights and electronics when not in use or when you leave the property.
- Please do not leave any trash or food outside as it may attract animals.
- Please respect our property and treat it as if it were your own.

### Safety

- Children must be supervised when using the hot tub. Teenagers may also need adult supervision.
- The spiral staircase has two child gates, one at the top and one at the bottom, that are easy to use.
- The Family Suite has a child lock which can be engaged for added safety.

### Security

- There are security cameras on the property for guest safety. Please note that these cameras do not look at any interior spaces.

We hope you enjoy your stay at Casa Patron and please let us know if there is anything we can do to make your stay more comfortable.
