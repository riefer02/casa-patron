### Accommodations

- A large pet crate on terrace can be moved inside if you need to leave your dog that may feel anxious while you are away.
- If you use the crate and your pup has an accident, please clean the area.
- There is urine spray on the bottom shelf in the kitchen. If a rug needs to be washed, put it downstairs near the hot tub and we will take it from there.
- If you leave pups when you go out to dinner or see the sites, we have a large dog crate which you are welcome to use.

### Walking Dogs

- It is safe to walk dogs on a leash in the neighborhood and around Casa Patron.
- Other people and their dogs may be walking there also.
- Large elk, wild horses, deer, wild turkeys, and skunks may be around Casa Patron in the mornings.
- Dogs who instinctively try to chase them can get hurt as they will stand their ground.
- Deer will run either across the road and dogs can follow.
- If they run down to the valley below the cabin, dogs can become disoriented and get lost.

### Cleaning Up After Pets

- If they relieve themselves close to the cabin we pick it up.
- Everyone loves the terrace with its birdâ€™s eye view of what is going on around the back or side of the cabin.
- Dogs naturally relieve themselves but we have that covered by using the urine spray in the kitchen.
- There are also dog water and food bowls.
- If a bowel movement happens on terrace or inside, just remove it, use urine spray, and clean the area. Gracias!
